Back in 2000 there was a boy named Edward DePew who wanted to serve his food to people all around the world. He though he was such a 
talented cook that people deserved to try some of his food. He had crazy ideas from chocolate spaghetti, to purple fried pickles. Who
knew that one day his dream of serving others would come to life. </p>
